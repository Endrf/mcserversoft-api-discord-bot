## Important
  ### I'm not that good at coding and just started so there are probably a lot of bugs and faults in my code. Use at your own risk.
## How To Setup (Discord Bot)
  #### 1. Download the discord bot by either clicking code and download zip or click on releases and download there.
  #### 2. Unzip the contents into a folder and edit config.json (scroll down to the config section if you don't know what to change)
  #### 3. Run the code in command prompt / terminal with the command "node ." (If that doesn't work then start it with the command "node main.js")
